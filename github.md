## LET'S BEGIN üî•

_Repository organizes single project.  It contains folder, files, video, spreadsheets and data sets with information about project.
Branch is a way to work on different versions of repository at a time. The default branch is main. 
Commits are saved changes on Github, with a description explaining why a particular change was made.
Pull request includes proposing changes and requesting others to review and pull in your contribution to merge into thier branch.
Merging pull request means bringing changes together._

## GITHUB FLOW ‚û°Ô∏è

*It is light weight, branch-based workflow that supprts teams and projects where deployements are made regularly. When you **create a branch** in project, you're creating an environment where you try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch dont affect main branch, so you are free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're **collaborating** with.Your branch name should be descriptive because it is created off main when working on a **feature** or **fix**.*

## GIT HANDBOOK üìò

_Version control system tracks (**VCS**) history of change as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project envolves, teams can **run tests**, **fix bugs**, and **contribute new code** with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can also **review project history** to find..._
*  Which changes were made?
*  Who made the changes?
*  When were the changes made?
*  Why were the changes needed?

_Distributed Version control system (**DVCs**) is commonly used for **open source** and **commercial software** development. They allow access to every file, branch and iteration of project, and allow every user access to full and self-contaimed **history** of all changes. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone._

**BASIC GIT COMMANDS** 

* git init - initialize brand new repository
* git clone - create local copy of project
* git add - adding files to snapshot
* git commit - saving the snapshot
* git status - show status of changes
* git branch - show branch worked locally
* git merge - merge line of development
* git pull - update local line of development
* git push - update repository with commits   
 
## HOW GITHUB WORK üöß

_GitHub builds collaboration directly into thye developmenmt process. Work is organized into repositories, where developers can outline requirements or directions and set expectations for team members. Developers simply create a branch to work on updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on same page._

### FORKING PROJECTS ‚ú®

_Creating a **fork** is producing personal copy of someone else's project. It acts as a sort of bridge between **original repository** and your **personal copy**. You can submit PULL Requests to help make other people's project better by offering your changes upto the original project.Pull Requests are an area of discussion._

It is **core** of **Social coding** on GitHub.

1. Fork the repository in header.
2. Clone or Download

## MASTER ISSUES üêõ

_Issues are great way to keep track of **tasks**, **enhancements**, and **bugs** for your project. They're kind like **email** -exept that can be shared and discussed with rest of your team. Most **software projects** have bug tracker of some kind. **GitHub's tracker** is called issues, and has its own section in repository.It is special because of our focus on collaboration, references, and excellent text formatting._

<b>TYPICAL ISSUE</b>

* Title and Description 
* Color-coded labels
* Milestone
* Assignee
* Comments

## Milestones üéØ

_They are **group of issues** that correspond to a **project**, **feature**, or **time period**. People use them in many different ways in software development. Some milestones are..._
1. Beta Launch - File bugs you need to fix before the launch of your beta project. It's great way to sure you're missing anything.
2. October Sprint - File issues that you'd like to work on in October. It's great way to focus on efforts when there's lot to do so.
3. Redesign - File issues related to redesigning of project. It's great way to collect ideas on what to work on.

## Labels üè∑Ô∏è

_It **organize** different types of **issues**. Issues can have as many labels as you want, and you can **filter** one or more **labels** at once. Some labels are..._
1. css
2. js
3. cofirmed
4. feature

## Assignees üôÜ
_**Assignee** is one **person** that's responsible for moving the **issue forward**. They are selected the same way milestones are, through the **grey bar** at **top of issue**._

## Notifications üîî

_There are **2** ways to recieve notifications,**email** and **web**. **Notifications** are GitHub's way to keep **up to date** with your issues. You can use them to **find out new repositories**, or just to know when someone need's your input to **move forward** on an **issue**. How you recieve notifications..._
1. Participating
2. Watching

## @Mentions üì≤
_It's way to reference other GitHub users inside of GitHub issues. Inside description or any comment of the issue, include the **@username** of another GitHub user to send them a notification.  Use **/cc** syntax to include people in issues._

>It looks function not working. Maybe a broser bug?
> @user1 @user2

_If you **dont know specific users** to include who might be able to help you, **reference** the **team** with @mentions. If browser-bug is team under klopo organization..._

>/cc@klopo/browser-bugs

## References ‚û°Ô∏è
_Often time issues are dependent on other issues, or at least relate to one of them and you'd like to connect the two. You can refer issues by typing in a **hashtag(#)** plus the **issue number**_


>Hey @user1, I think problem started in #49

_By doing this, we **create** an **event** inside of issue #49. If there is issue in another repository, just include the issue number inside of the commit message. By prefacing your commits with "**Fixes**", "**Fixed**", "**Fix**", "**Closes**", "**Closed**", "**Close**" when commit is merged into main, it will close the issue. It is great way to **add visibility** into **history** of **project**._

## Search ‚ùì
_At **top** of each page, there is a search box that lets you **search** through issues.You can scope results by..._
1. Keyword, such as all issues mentioning sidebar
2. State, such as all issues mentioning sidebar that are closed.
3. Assignee, such that all issues mentioning sidebar that were assigned to @klo

## Overviews & Reports
_Outside issue section, there are 2 other pages that help **summarize what's going on** with **issues across** all of your **repositories**._

## The Issue Dashboard üìã
_If you use **organizations**,each one has its own Issue Dashboard that **separates** out **issue** within the organization. It is for **broader listing** of all your issues across many projects. It can be a great **tool**. Issue section of dashboard collect issues differently..._
1. All issues in repositories you own and collaborate own
2. Issues assigned to you
3. Issues you've created

## Pulse üü™
_Pulse is **snapshot** of everything that happened in **last repository** in the past week(day,past 3 month). It's a great way to catchup with repositories when you've been away and don't want the granularity notifications offer when watching a repository._
